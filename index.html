        <h2>#IndiaFightsCorona ~ Covid 19</h2>
        <p>COVID-19 (Coronavirus) has affected day to day life and is slowing down the global economy. This pandemic has
            affected thousands of peoples, who are either sick or are being killed due to the spread of this disease.
            The most common symptoms of this viral infection are fever, cold, cough, bone pain and breathing problems,
            and ultimately leading to pneumonia. This, being a new viral disease affecting humans for the first time,
            vaccines are not yet available. Thus, the emphasis is on taking extensive precautions such as extensive
            hygiene protocol (e.g., regularly washing of hands, avoidance of face to face interaction etc.), social
            distancing, and wearing of masks, and so on. This virus is spreading exponentially region wise. Countries
            are banning gatherings of people to the spread and break the exponential curve.1 , 2 Many countries are
            locking their population and enforcing strict quarantine to control the spread of the havoc of this highly
            communicable disease.</p>

        <p>COVID-19 has rapidly affected our day to day life, businesses, disrupted the world trade and movements.
            Identification of the disease at an early stage is vital to control the spread of the virus because it very
            rapidly spreads from person to person. Most of the countries have slowed down their manufacturing of the
            products.3 , 4 The various industries and sectors are affected by the cause of this disease; these include
            the pharmaceuticals industry, solar power sector, tourism, Information and electronics industry. This virus
            creates significant knock-on effects on the daily life of citizens, as well as about the global economy.</p>

                    <p>The time taken by the symptoms to first appear on an infected individual. The incubation time for
                        COVID-19 ranges from 1-14 days, most commonly being around 5 days.</p>

                    <summary>Can people with mild COVID-19 symptoms recover at home?</summary>
                    <p>People with mild symptoms who are otherwise healthy should manage their symptoms at home. On
                        average it takes 5–6 days from when someone is infected with the virus for symptoms to show,
                        however it can take up to 14 days.</p>

                    <summary>Are COVID-19 vaccines safe even though the vaccines were developed rapidly?</summary>
                    <p>While COVID-19 vaccines were developed rapidly, all steps were taken to make sure they are safe
                        and effective:
                    <ul class="summary-list">
                        <li>Approach to Development – Scientists have been working for many years to develop vaccines
                            against viruses like the one that causes COVID-19. This knowledge helped speed up the
                            initial development of the current COVID-19 vaccines.</li>
                        <li>Clinical Trials – All vaccines in the United States must go through three phases of clinical
                            trials to make sure they are safe and effective. During the development of COVID-19
                            vaccines, phases overlapped to speed up the process, but all phases were completed.</li>
                        <li>Authorization or Approval – Before vaccines are available to people, the U.S. Food and Drug
                            Administration (FDA) assesses the findings from clinical trials. FDA determined that three
                            COVID-19 vaccines met FDA's safety and effectiveness standards and granted those vaccines
                            Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs). This allowed the vaccines to be quickly distributed to
                            control the pandemic.</li>
